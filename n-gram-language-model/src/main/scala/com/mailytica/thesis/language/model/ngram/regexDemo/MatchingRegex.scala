    """Quantum computing is the use of quantum-mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement
      |to perform computation. Computers that perform quantum computations are known as quantum computers.
      |Quantum computers are believed to be able to solve certain computational problems, such as integer
      |factorization (which underlies RSA encryption), substantially faster than classical computers.
      |The study of quantum computing is a subfield of quantum information science. Quantum computing
      |began in the early 1980s, when physicist Paul Benioff proposed a quantum mechanical model of the
      |Turing machine. Richard Feynman and Yuri Manin later suggested that a quantum computer had the
      |potential to simulate things that a classical computer could not. In 1994, Peter Shor developed
      |a quantum algorithm for factoring integers that had the potential to decrypt RSA-encrypted
      |communications. Despite ongoing experimental progress since the late 1990s, most researchers
      |believe that "fault-tolerant quantum computing is still a rather distant dream." In recent years,
      |investment into quantum computing research has increased in both the public and private sector.
      |On 23 October 2019, Google AI, in partnership with the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space
      |Administration (NASA), published a paper in which they claimed to have achieved quantum supremacy.
      |While some have disputed this claim, it is still a significant milestone in the history of
      |quantum computing.""".stripMargin,
